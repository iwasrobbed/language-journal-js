# Quick start

The only development dependency of this project is [node.js](https://nodejs.org), so just make sure you have it installed.

```
cd language-journal
yarn install
npm start
```
... and boom! You have a running desktop application on your screen.

# Keys

There is an `.env` file and a `gtranslate_secret.json` file you'll need to add your own keys to.
